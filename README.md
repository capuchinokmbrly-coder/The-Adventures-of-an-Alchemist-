Preview: TAoaA is a turn - based, RPG python game that tackles a short story revolving around Guita, a healing mage.

This story was loosely inspired by Fairy Tail by Hiro Mashima and Apothecary Diaries by Natsu Hyuga.

A finals project for Programming 1. I deeply apologize for the short execution of the project. Due to the frustrating and indecisive revisions of the story, I opted to use the shorten version. Obvious or not, the story is rushly written.
